# KyotoUx009x - Stochastic Processes - Data Analysis and Computer Simulation
[Here is the link to the course on edx](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:KyotoUx+009x+2T2017/course/)</br>

There are total 6 weeks in the course. </br>
The course is mainly focus on the basic model of Brownian Motion for around 3 weeks.</br>
And the first week is a tutorial of python, the second week is a review of statistics. </br>
Finally, the last week is about an application of Stochastic Processing in Stock Market.</br>

This is a good course for some body who is the first time to learn what is Stochastic Processing.</br>
In the course, you will learn some basic knowledge of Stochastic Processing and How to use Python to Sumulate it.</br>
However, it is better to a bit basic statistics and programming knowledge before taking this course.</br>
Besides, if you want to learn more about the mathematics and physics behind the processing, this course may not be situable for you.</br>


As a whole, it is a good course to know what is Stochastic Processes.</br>
