# DAT210x Programming with Python for Data Science

This is a [online course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DAT210x+1T2017/course/) in MOOC platform - [edX](https://www.edx.org/). <br/>
It is a quite useful course, if you learning data science or machine learning first time, but mathematics behind the methods is a little bit less. <br/> 
Also, this is easier than the famous machine learning course which is taught by andrew ng, but it is better to use python to learn for the first time I think. <br/>
The version of python is 3.5, so there is a litte bit changing with the codes the course giving, and there is a little bit unfinished. <br/>
Just for reference.<br/>
