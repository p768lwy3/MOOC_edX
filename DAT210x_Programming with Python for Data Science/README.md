#DAT210x Programming with Python for Data Science
This is a online course in MOOC platform - edX. It is a quite useful course, if you learning data science or machine learning first time, but mathematics behind the methods is a little bit less, and this is easier than the famous machine learning course which is taught by andrew ng, but it is better to use python to learn for the first time I think.
The version of python is 3.5, so there is a litte bit changing with the codes the course giving, and there is a little bit unfinished.
Just for reference.
